BUDDY PHASE 7 READINESS REPORT
===============================
Generated: 2026-02-05T20:37:19.699178

What worked well:
- Priority scheduling and dependency resolution were stable.
- Conditional branching produced additional tasks reliably.
- Approval gating and mock Soul validation generated consistent routing.

Pain points in defining workflows:
- Expressing ambiguous goals required manual confidence tuning.
- Conditional branches required explicit templates and dependencies.
- Recovery required manual reconstruction of pending tasks.

Where visualization would help:
- Visual dependency graphs for workflows.
- Real-time queue depth and task state transitions.
- Confidence + approval overlays per step.

Scheduler features to expose visually:
- Priority ordering and dependency satisfaction.
- Conditional branching paths and triggered outcomes.
- Retry counts and failure reasons.

Concepts users may struggle to express without a UI:
- Multi-branch conditional logic.
- Recovery expectations and manual checkpointing.
- Risk and approval boundaries for mixed-risk workflows.
