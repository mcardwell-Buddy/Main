# Phase 11 Self-Driven Learning Report — Autonomous Adaptation

Generated: 2026-02-05T22:00:31.327488

## Executive Summary
Phase 11 ingested Phase 10 outputs, analyzed 19 task outcomes, identified 3 learning insights, and generated autonomous goals for 3 waves.

## Learning Insights from Phase 10
### Deferred High Risk
- **Description:** 2 high-risk tasks deferred (avg conf: 0.62)
- **Confidence:** 0.95
- **Recommendation:** Implement confidence-boosting strategies via low-risk precursor tasks

### High Success Risk Level
- **Description:** LOW risk tasks show 100% success rate
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Recommendation:** Consider increasing complexity for LOW risk workflows

### High Success Risk Level
- **Description:** MEDIUM risk tasks show 100% success rate
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Recommendation:** Consider increasing complexity for MEDIUM risk workflows

## Wave Statistics
- Wave 1: total=8, completed=8, failed=0, deferred=0, autonomous_goals=3
- Wave 2: total=8, completed=8, failed=0, deferred=0, autonomous_goals=3
- Wave 3: total=8, completed=8, failed=0, deferred=0, autonomous_goals=3

## Safety & Adaptation
- High-risk tasks remain deferred unless confidence >= 0.8
- All executions remain dry-run
- Autonomous goals generated based on learning insights
- Policy updates logged per wave
